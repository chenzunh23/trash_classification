# trash_classification

## Course project for Computer Vision, IIIS, Tsinghua University

A simple platform for garbage classification. You can easily train, evaluate, and test a YOLOv8 model on custom datasets.

All our data are labeled using the TACO format.

TACO data can be downloaded from the official implementation https://github.com/pedropro/TACO

When TACO dataset is downloaded, you can also visualize TACO data and train on it.

To run experiments using MaskRCNN and DeepLabV3+, check out https://github.com/dbash/zerowaste, our experiments are run on this platform.
